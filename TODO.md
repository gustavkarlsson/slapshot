# TODO:s
* Finish implementing and test image snapshots

## Before next release
* Setup library API stability check

## At some point
* Stop using actual snapshot tests in modules. Also remove the gradle input/outputs for the snapshot directories.
* Support side effects (such as screenshot diffs)
* Consider migrating slapshot-plugin to use mavenPublishing plugin
