# TODO:s

## Before next release
* Add CI status check
* Test passing actions as Gradle properties or setting in plugin extension
* Extract heavier snapshot formats (Image, JSON, Ktor) to separate libs

## At some point
* Setup library API stability check
* Consider migrating slapshot-plugin to use mavenPublishing plugin
* Support side effects (such as screenshot diffs)
