# TODO:s

## Before next release
* Test passing actions as Gradle properties or setting in plugin extension
* Split up serializing/deserializing from comparing. Would allow for generic snapshots such as lists, sets, maps, etc.
* Add web server sample
* Extract heavier snapshot formats (Image, JSON, Ktor) to separate libs

## At some point
* Setup library API stability check
* Consider migrating slapshot-plugin to use mavenPublishing plugin
