# TODO:s

## Before next release
* Add tests for DefaultSnapshotter (needs virtual FS?)
* Extract buffered image lib (and remove dependency on coroutines from core)

## At some point
* Setup library API stability check
* Consider migrating slapshot-plugin to use mavenPublishing plugin
* Support side effects (such as screenshot diffs)
